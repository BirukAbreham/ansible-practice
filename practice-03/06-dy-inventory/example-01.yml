# Dynamic Inventories
# ---------------------
# - A dynamic inventory script is an executable program that can build an inventory automatically
# - Usually used to get information from an external "source of truth" like a CMDB
# - Configured in the same way as a static inventory file, but marked with executable permissions
#       chmod a+x inventory-script.py
# - Can be written in any programming language that provides inventory output in JSON format
